# Overview

Collatz.m will show you the Collatz Sequence for the specified whole number, then print a graph that will display the results.

If you are unfamiliar with the "Collatz Conjecture," the wikipedia link goes into depth about what it is and a numberphile video explains it pretty well too:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
* [Numberphile Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFpVDpKX70)

(I recommend trying the number 63728127; it produces a very interesting graph)

###### Please run the .m file in MATLAB (anything on or past version 2019a to avoid compatibility issues)
